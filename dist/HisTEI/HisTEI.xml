                <p class="header">What's new?</p>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.5</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Several new tags have been added (with buttons too!)</li>
                    <li>title: you can now mark stretches of text as representing the Title of a something, e.g. a book or play. 
                    You can save a link to the book by using the ref attribute (e.g. Google Books)</li>
                    <li>Revision Description and Changes</li>
                    <li>You can now store information about the status of your transcriptions within the revisionDesc element in the TEI Header.
                    Each change made to the document is recorded in a change element with the status of the document, the date and time as well as the person who made the change</li>
                    <li>To take advantage of the person who made changes, you need to add a new list of people in your Person contextual_info file with a type of &apos;editor&apos;</li>
                    <li>Use the button on the toolbar or in the menu to insert a change (can be done from anywhere in the document)</li>
                    <li>If you created a transcript from an older template and don't have a revisionDesc, use this button to insert one into the TEI Header</li>
                    <li>New Annotations</li>
                    <li>num: you can now mark up numbers that occur within the text. 
                        In the Annotations view (under Styles) you can also save metadata about what the actual number is</li>
                    <li>measure: you can now mark up amounts of things, e.g. $20.00. Here too you can save metadata about what sort of measure it is</li>
                    <li>Addresses</li>
                    <li>You can now insert addresses either as a separate div or within the opener or closer or even within the text itself. By default
                    each new Address comes with an address line, street and city</li>
                    <li>In addition, all sub-elements of an address can now be added from the Addresses menu/toolbar in the Contextual Info menu/toolbar</li>
                    <li>You can also insert a div to hold information about any stamps found on a letter</li>
                    <li>Contextual Info</li>
                    <li>You can now normalize all Contextual Info elements within the text - when placing the cursor inside one of these elements, a dropdown
                    box appears with the list of normalized entities from the Contextual Info files</li>
                    <li>The place file has been updated, so you can select other place types within each kind of place (e.g. for Settlements, you can now select
                    a Region and Country rather than typing it again. This helps with normalization within places</li>
                    <li>There's more, but it's too much to type here! :-)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.3</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After a higher-than-average "duh!" factor, I finally figured out that we can have <b>both</b> manual line breaks (i.e. TEI <code>lb</code> elements)
                            <b>as well as text wrapping at the same time</b>. Now, by default, new lines are created for manual line breaks as well as when the text
                            stretches past the edge of the Oxygen window.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means, of course, if the Oxygen window is too narrow, a text with line breaks will still wrap.
                            So, I added a new command to allow toggling text wrapping <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> completely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can find this command on the <i>Formats</i> menu with the label <i>Toggle Text Wrap</i>.
                            I also added a button to the Formats toolbar: it's a capital <i>A</i> with
                            a blue arrow pointing backwards (to represent wrapping the text to a new line).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By default, text wrapping is <b>ON</b>. Click the button once to turn it <b>OFF</b>.
                            At that point, only manual line breaks within the text will be used to wrap to a new line.
                            Click it again to turn it back <b>ON</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, since text wrapping is <b>ON</b> by default now, it is more difficult to see clearly where manual line breaks are, so
                            I added an icon (an arrow pointing down and back) that is displayed inline within the text to represent manual line breaks.
                            Please let me know what you think of this!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I removed the old way of wrapping text (namely with another CSS stylesheet which used to be accessed via the
                            <i>Styles</i> toolbar)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I also added many new styles for elements in the TEI Header (mainly in the <code>titleStmt</code> and <code>encodingDesc</code> elements). 
                        It's now much closer to handling all possible fields in these elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type dropdowns are also now available for <code>head</code> and <code>title</code> elements in order to distinguish between 
                        main and sub headings and titles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        TIFF Images now supported: When setting a new base directory for the <code>facsimile</code> element, 
                        TIFF image files are recognized and added to the list of graphics
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.2</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added links to the end of glosses, so you can get back to the spot in the text that they refer to!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added new CSS to render texts with no line breaks using normal text flow. This is handy for digitized published works
                        in which the physical line breaks are unimportant. To switch between the two modes, select the Styles button/dropdown
                        and then pick the <i>Document Wrap Text</i> option. Brought to you buy the burgeoning HisTEI user community :-)

                <p class="header">Version 0.4.0</p>
