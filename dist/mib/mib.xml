                <p class="header">What's new?</p>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.2</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added links to the end of glosses, so you can get back to the spot in the text that they refer to!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Updated the CSS so all annotations are shown inline now instead of block (i.e. a new line for each one).
                        This should avoid the problem of inserting whitespace between two annotations where there shouldn't be any
                        (like in the olden days when folks wrote several words together as one word)
                    </li>
                    <li> Added type dropdown to word annotations. You must add the new section to
                        your Contextual Info annotation.xml file (see that template for an example
                        and/or to copy/paste it) </li>
                    <li> Added new CSS to render texts with no line breaks using normal text flow.
                        This is handy for digitized published works in which the physical line
                        breaks are unimportant. To switch between the two modes, select the Styles
                        button/dropdown and then pick the <i>Document Wrap Text</i> option. Brought
                        to you buy the burgeoning HisTEI user community :-) </li>
                    <li>Oh and a couple o' bugs were squashed along the way</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.0</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First release of the framework Medieval Irish Bilingualism</li>
                    <li>First release for HisTEI on GitHub including a new HisTEI default
                        framework</li>
                    <li>Unicode character buttons were added to a menu with shortcut keys</li>
                    <li><code>s</code>, <code>cl</code>, <code>phr</code> and <code>w</code>
                        elements were added</li>
                    <li> Glosses can be inserted and linked using the <code>gloss</code> element and
                            <code>@target</code> attribute. These refer to places in the text marked
                        up with an xml:id using the <code>ab</code>, <code>seg</code> or
                            <code>term</code> elements. </li>
                </ul>
