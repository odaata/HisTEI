                    <li>
                        After a higher-than-average "duh!" factor, I finally figured out that we can have both manual line breaks
                        as well as text wrapping naturally at the same time. Line breaks are now represented in the text with an icon, 
                        so it's clearly shown
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.2</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added links to the end of glosses, so you can get back to the spot in the text that they refer to!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added new CSS to render texts with no line breaks using normal text flow. This is handy for digitized published works
                        in which the physical line breaks are unimportant. To switch between the two modes, select the Styles button/dropdown
                        and then pick the <i>Document Wrap Text</i> option. Brought to you buy the burgeoning HisTEI user community :-)
