                <p class="header">What's new?</p>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.3</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            After a higher-than-average "duh!" factor, I finally figured out that we can have <b>both</b> manual line breaks (i.e. TEI <code>lb</code> elements)
                            <b>as well as text wrapping at the same time</b>. Now, by default, new lines are created for manual line breaks as well as when the text
                            stretches past the edge of the Oxygen window.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means, of course, if the Oxygen window is too narrow, a text with line breaks will still wrap.
                            So, I added a new command to allow toggling text wrapping <b>ON</b> and <b>OFF</b> completely.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can find this command on the <i>Formats</i> menu with the label <i>Toggle Text Wrap</i>.
                            I also added a button to the Formats toolbar: it's a capital <i>A</i> with
                            a blue arrow pointing backwards (to represent wrapping the text to a new line).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By default, text wrapping is <b>ON</b>. Click the button once to turn it <b>OFF</b>.
                            At that point, only manual line breaks within the text will be used to wrap to a new line.
                            Click it again to turn it back <b>ON</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, since text wrapping is <b>ON</b> by default now, it is more difficult to see clearly where manual line breaks are, so
                            I added an icon (an arrow pointing down and back) that is displayed inline within the text to represent manual line breaks.
                            Please let me know what you think of this!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I removed the old way of wrapping text (namely with another CSS stylesheet which used to be accessed via the
                            <i>Styles</i> toolbar)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I also added many new styles for elements in the TEI Header (mainly in the <code>titleStmt</code> and <code>encodingDesc</code> elements).
                        It's now much closer to handling all possible fields in these elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type dropdowns are also now available for <code>head</code> and <code>title</code> elements in order to distinguish between
                        main and sub headings and titles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        TIFF Images now supported: When setting a new base directory for the <code>facsimile</code> element,
                        TIFF image files are recognized and added to the list of graphics
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.2</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added links to the end of glosses, so you can get back to the spot in the text that they refer to!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added new CSS to render texts with no line breaks using normal text flow. This is handy for digitized published works
                        in which the physical line breaks are unimportant. To switch between the two modes, select the Styles button/dropdown
                        and then pick the <i>Document Wrap Text</i> option. Brought to you buy the burgeoning HisTEI user community :-)
                    </li>
                    <li>Oh and a couple o' bugs were squashed along the way</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.0</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First release for HisTEI on GitHub including a new HisTEI default framework</li>
                    <li>The Java classes now reside in a new package: info.histei</li>
                    <li>All classes with <code>EMST</code> prefix in the name have been changed to the prefix <code>HT</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.09</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completely reconfigured keyboard shortcuts - mouse over the buttons to see what the current
                        shortcut is for any button
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.08</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We now have buttons for adding
                        <code>dateline</code>
                        and
                        <code>signed</code>
                        elements into the
                        <code>opener</code>
                        or
                        <code>closer</code>
                        sections.
                        Oh and the closer now includes a
                        <code>dateline</code>
                        element by default now, when a new one is inserted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added starting set of suggested values for the
                        <code>type</code>
                        attribute on elements beneath the
                        <code>creation</code>
                        element in the header.
                        But don't worry, you can still type anything there that suits your fancy! And we will surely be
                        adding more as we transcribe more text types (oh and don't call me Shirley!)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added
                        <code>@script</code>
                        dropdown to<code>handNote</code>s and<code>handShift</code>s,
                        so you can indicate that a hand copied the original, while also indicating what the original
                        hand was - confused yet? ME TOO! ;-)
                    </li>
                    <li>forme work elements (<code>fw</code>) can now be added to paragraphs (<code>p</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>Made IDs for Orgs editable with textfield, so you can name archives and other organizations</li>
                    <li>Set type dropdown boxes to a default size so it's easier to enter new text into them</li>
                    <li>Force page refresh after updating
                        <code>Facsimile</code>
                        elements, so the dropdown lists are always up to
                        date
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.07</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added
                        <code>@break</code>
                        attribute to page breaks (<code>pb</code>) so
                        words can be broken over page breaks as well now!
                    </li>
                    <li>Tweaked the look n' feel of page breaks - less white space below them
                        now
                    </li>
                    <li>Changed the
                        <code>background-color</code>
                        for abbreviations
                        (<code>abbr</code>) so they're easier to differentiate from expansions
                        (<code>expan</code>)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.06</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New buttons for inserting:
                        <br/>
                        <code>opener</code>,<code>closer</code>,<code>postscript</code>, and
                        <code>respStmt</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>The keys for the
                        <code>respStmt</code>
                        were taken from the
                        <a
                                href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html">MARC Code List for
                            Relators
                        </a>
                        <br/>
                        It's an international standard used by librarians - only a small
                        subset are available on the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>When adding a new
                        <code>respStmt</code>
                        a dialog box appears where you can
                        select them from the list.
                        <br/>
                        (Unfortunately) it has to be done twice to
                        fill in the key and the label, but hey you won't be adding it
                        <i>that</i>
                        often, right?
                    </li>
                    <li>Needed more screen space, so there is now an
                        <i>Insert</i>
                        menu on the
                        <i>Sections</i>
                        toolbar
                        <br/>
                        From there, you can insert larger
                        sections, like the newly added ones as well as
                        <code>div</code>
                        's
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug: dropdown lists weren't refreshing after inserting new facsimile
                        elements:
                        <code>graphic</code>
                        and
                        <code>media</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.05</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dropdown boxes now appear when the element has focus instead of when
                        hovering over it with the mouse<br/>(Except for elements that don't have
                        text, like<code>gap</code>,<code>handShift</code>, and<code>ptr</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>Increased speed for large documents ('Twas a wee bit sluggish)</li>
                    <li>Minor bug fixes with paths and dropdown list contents</li>
                </ul>
