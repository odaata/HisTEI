                <p class="header">Version 0.4.1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added new CSS to render texts with no line breaks using normal text flow. This is handy for digitized published works
                        in which the physical line breaks are unimportant. To switch between the two modes, select the Styles button/dropdown
                        and then pick the <i>Document Wrap Text</i> option. Brought to you buy the burgeoning HisTEI user community :-)
                    </li>
                    <li>Oh and a couple o' bugs were squashed along the way</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.4.0</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First release for HisTEI on GitHub including a new HisTEI default framework</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.09</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completely reconfigured keyboard shortcuts according to
                        <code>Shortcuts.docx</code>
                        - which we puzzled over in Femke's lovely new apartment
                    </li>
                    <li>Moved all capital letters to their own submenu in EMST menu and EMST Characters toolbar called
                        (guess what?)
                        <em>Capitals</em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.08</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We now have buttons for adding
                        <code>dateline</code>
                        and
                        <code>signed</code>
                        elements into the
                        <code>opener</code>
                        or
                        <code>closer</code>
                        sections.
                        Oh and the closer now includes a
                        <code>dateline</code>
                        element by default now, when a new one is inserted
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added starting set of suggested values for the
                        <code>type</code>
                        attribute on elements beneath the
                        <code>creation</code>
                        element in the header.
                        But don't worry, you can still type anything there that suits your fancy! And we will surely be
                        adding more as we transcribe more text types (oh and don't call me Shirley!)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added
                        <code>@script</code>
                        dropdown to<code>handNote</code>s and<code>handShift</code>s,
                        so you can indicate that a hand copied the original, while also indicating what the original
                        hand was - confused yet? ME TOO! ;-)
                    </li>
                    <li>forme work elements (<code>fw</code>) can now be added to paragraphs (<code>p</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>Made IDs for Orgs editable with textfield, so you can name archives and other organizations</li>
                    <li>Set type dropdown boxes to a default size so it's easier to enter new text into them</li>
                    <li>Force page refresh after updating
                        <code>Facsimile</code>
                        elements, so the dropdown lists are always up to
                        date
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.07</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added
                        <code>@break</code>
                        attribute to page breaks (<code>pb</code>) so
                        words can be broken over page breaks as well now!
                    </li>
                    <li>Tweaked the look n' feel of page breaks - less white space below them
                        now
                    </li>
                    <li>Changed the
                        <code>background-color</code>
                        for abbreviations
                        (<code>abbr</code>) so they're easier to differentiate from expansions
                        (<code>expan</code>)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.06</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New buttons for inserting:
                        <br/>
                        <code>opener</code>,<code>closer</code>,<code>postscript</code>, and
                        <code>respStmt</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>The keys for the
                        <code>respStmt</code>
                        were taken from the
                        <a
                                href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html">MARC Code List for
                            Relators
                        </a>
                        <br/>
                        It's an international standard used by librarians - only a small
                        subset are available on the list.
                    </li>
                    <li>When adding a new
                        <code>respStmt</code>
                        a dialog box appears where you can
                        select them from the list.
                        <br/>
                        (Unfortunately) it has to be done twice to
                        fill in the key and the label, but hey you won't be adding it
                        <i>that</i>
                        often, right?
                    </li>
                    <li>Needed more screen space, so there is now an
                        <i>Insert</i>
                        menu on the
                        <i>Sections</i>
                        toolbar
                        <br/>
                        From there, you can insert larger
                        sections, like the newly added ones as well as
                        <code>div</code>
                        's
                    </li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug: dropdown lists weren't refreshing after inserting new facsimile
                        elements:
                        <code>graphic</code>
                        and
                        <code>media</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="header">Version 0.3.05</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dropdown boxes now appear when the element has focus instead of when
                        hovering over it with the mouse<br/>(Except for elements that don't have
                        text, like<code>gap</code>,<code>handShift</code>, and<code>ptr</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>Increased speed for large documents ('Twas a wee bit sluggish)</li>
                    <li>Minor bug fixes with paths and dropdown list contents</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
